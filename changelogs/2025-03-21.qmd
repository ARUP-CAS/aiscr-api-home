New AMCR OAI-PMH API version is released together with updated [schema](https://api.aiscr.cz/schema/amcr/2.1/){.external}.
This version reacts to development of AMCR and its v1.1.0 release (see [changelog](https://github.com/ARUP-CAS/aiscr-webamcr/releases/tag/v1.1.0){.external}), major change  being introduction of persistent identifiers (DOIs, IGSNs etc.)

Data following the old (**v2.0**) schema remain available under <https://api.aiscr.cz/2.0/oai> endpoint, while data following the new (**v2.1**) schema are available under <https://api.aiscr.cz/2.1/oai> endpoint.

Default endpoint (<https://api.aiscr.cz/oai>) returns data in the most recent version of the schema.
